DNA sequencing determines the nucleic acid sequence or order of nucleotides in DNA. In mammalian DNA, the four nucleotides bases are adenine, guanine, cytosine, and thymine --- or A, G, C, T by conventional abbreviation. Moreover, they each map to a specific other nucleotide within a DNA strand thus:

| nucleotide | maps to | nucleotide |
| ---------- | ------- | ---------- |
| A          | ----->  | T          |
| G          | ----->  | C          |
| C          | ----->  | G          |
| T          | ----->  | A          |
