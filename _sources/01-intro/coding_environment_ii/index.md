# Coding Environment Part II

We will be using a few different coding environments, i.e., places where a Python interpreter can run our code.

First, a sort of __standard__ Python coding environment, which we'll discuss in a lot more detail.

Second, we will use `Jupyter Notebooks`, much like what appears on the next page.

Third, eventually we will use your own machine, i.e., your own computer.  (We'll cover installation in the coming days.)
