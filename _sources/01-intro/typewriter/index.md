# Coding as a Manual Labor

> What the hand does the mind remembers. - Maria Montessori

This is an approximation of the typewriter I used in school, purchased when a sophomore in high school and used throughout college and graduate school.

Many my age or just younger will recall the purchase of a Commodore or Apple in the very early days of personal computing in the 1980s.  I had no such luck.

But what I lacked in access to 'technology' I, in some ways, made up for by learning to type and type fast.

```{tip} In coding, keyboarding, i.e., the manual effort to put code to text, is, for most mere mortals, an essential skill -- __essential__ as in, "You may not think it important, but it makes a gargantuan difference in your coding work."
```

You'll often hear the term __source code__.

That's the code you, the programmer, must write/type.  And you'll be doing a ___lot___ of that.

The benefit of learning the basic finger:key mappings is one you cannot appreciate until you have both a great deal to do and merely __hunt and peck__ skills.

Moreover, you'll be less hesitant to test and re-test coding tests, drills, experiments, whatever.

Finally, coding is a manual labor as much as a mental one.  You learn by your tactile sense as well as your sense of design and your aptitude for problem-solving.
