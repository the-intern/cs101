procedure
  _A procedure is a description of a process. A simple process can be described just by listing the steps. The list of steps is the procedure; the act of following them is the process. A procedure that can be followed without any thought is called a mechanical procedure._ {cite}`Dave_Evans`; the two fundamental types of procedures are (1) functions, and (2) methods.  The distinction is important after you understand `classes` in Python.
