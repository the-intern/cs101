I did the calculations, assuming our rocket reached maximum
velocity immediately upon launch and rounding o the altitude to
ten thousand feet. The result equaled a velocity of eight hundred
feet per second, or 545.45 miles per hour. When I recalculated, I
came up with the same result. This was more than ve times faster
than the Buick could do on Little Daytona, and I found it dicult to
imagine one of our rockets could really go that fast. I shoved the
notebook away and threw down my pencil. “This can’t be right.” I
was disgusted. I couldn’t even do the rst simple equation.
Quentin took a quick look and pushed the notebook back to me.
“It is exactly correct. Keep going. Don’t lose your nerve.”
“I haven’t lost my nerve!” I snapped. But I had. The next step was
to do the equations for the design of the De Laval nozzle, and
privately I quaked at the thought of attempting them. There were
dozens of them, intricate, enmeshed, one building on the other—one
wrong, all wrong. “You had the calculus class, Quentin. You work
them.”
“No,” he said adamantly. “Miss Riley gave you the book. You
know calculus as well as I do. Quit stalling!”
My condence was gone. Doing those equations was like running
a four-minute mile—something possible only for someone far
greater than I.
Quentin leaned forward and shook his nger at me. “Listen, old
man, if you don’t work these equations, what will be the point of all
we’ve done? We might end up building a good rocket that’ll y just
ne, and all the grown-ups and teachers will brag on us. Who
knows? We might even be able to blu our way past the judges at
the science fair. But you’ll know and I’ll know—all the boys will
know—what could have been done if you hadn’t lost your nerve. We
could have built a great rocket.”
