```{admonition} Rockets Move on More Than Fuel

_Quentin leaned forward and shook his finger at me. "Listen, old man, if you don’t work these equations, what will be the point of all we’ve done? We might end up building a good rocket that’ll fly just fine, and all the grown-ups and teachers will brag on us. Who knows? We might even be able to bluff our way past the judges at the science fair. But you’ll know and I’ll know — all the boys will know — what could have been done if you hadn’t lost your nerve. We could have built a great rocket."_

I did the calculations, assuming our rocket reached maximum velocity ... The result equaled a velocity of ... 545.45 miles per hour. When I recalculated, I came up with the same result. ... I found it difficult to imagine ... our rockets could really go that fast... "This can’t be right.'

Quentin took a quick look and pushed the notebook back to me.

"It is exactly correct. Keep going. Don’t lose your nerve."

"I haven’t lost my nerve!" I snapped. But I had. The next step was to do the equations for ... the De Laval nozzle, and privately I quaked at the thought of attempting them ... dozens of them, intricate, enmeshed, one building on the other—one wrong, all wrong.

"You had the calculus class, Quentin. You work
them."

"No," he said adamantly. "Miss Riley gave you the book. You know calculus as well as I do. Quit stalling!"

My confidence was gone. Doing those equations was like running a four-minute mile—something possible only for someone far greater than I.

Quentin leaned forward and shook his finger at me. "Listen, old man, if you don’t work these equations, what will be the point of all we’ve done? We might end up building a good rocket that’ll fly just fine, and all the grown-ups and teachers will brag on us. Who knows? We might even be able to bluff our way past the judges at the science fair. But you’ll know and I’ll know — all the boys will know — what could have been done if you hadn’t lost your nerve.
