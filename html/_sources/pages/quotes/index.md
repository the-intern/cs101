# Quotations


>  ``I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of course, the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while we began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines. I don't think we are. I think we're responsible for stretching them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun. Above all, I hope we don't become missionaries. Don't feel as if you're Bible salesmen. The world has too many of those already. What you know about computing other people will learn. Don't feel as if the key to successful computing is only in your hands. What's in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more.''

  - > To appreciate programming as an intellectual activity in its own right you must turn to computer programming; you must read and write computer programs -- many of them. It doesn't matter much what the programs are about or what applications they serve. What does matter is how well they perform and how smoothly they fit with other programs in the creation of still greater programs. The programmer must seek both perfection of part and adequacy of collection.  = _Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, second edition, Harold Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman with Julie Sussman, from Forward by Alan J. Perlis_

    - > A web crawler is a program that collects content from the web. A web crawler finds web pages by starting from a seed page and following links to find other pages, and following links from the other pages it finds, and continuing to follow links until it has found many web pages. =de
    - Show off example
      - > Start from one preselected page. We call the starting page the "seed" page. Extract all the links on that page. (This is the part we will work on in this unit and Unit 2.) Follow each of those links to find new pages. Extract all the links from all of the new pages found. Follow each of those links to find new pages. Extract all the links from all of the new pages found. This keeps going as long as there are new pages to find, or until it is stopped. =de
