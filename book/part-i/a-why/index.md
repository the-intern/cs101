# A. Why

````{card} Man Made Code
> God made the angels to show him splendor, as he made animals for innocence and plants for their simplicity.  But _Man_ he made to serve him wittily, in the tangle of his mind.

Sir Thomas More, _Man for All Seasons_ (Bolt)

## Mind

Perhaps apocryphal, nonetheless it is said that, above the entrance to ancient schools of philosophy, a placard warned would-be students, __Let no one enter who has not studied _The Elements_ .__

The point need hardly have been made many centuries ago, but here __we__ are.

__The Elements__ are those of Euclid, the ancient mathematician whose work on the principles and theorems and proofs of geometry were considered part of a basic, foundational education.

Why? Among other reasons, the close study of it trained the mind to be more precise in its reasoning, the very attribute that enables human beings to irrigate deserts, cure illnesses, construct cities, cultivate land, build a culture.

Abraham Lincoln, when traveling the court circuit on horseback, studied the __The Elements__ -- and not because he aspired to land surveyor.  He sought to improve his ability to reason, to argue, to understand.

We might study biology or chemistry or history primarily (not solely) to understand the subject.  But a number of topics we study foremost for something beyond that.

Geometry, algebra, music all have a first end; but it's their effect on apprehension, judgment, and reason that make them valuable beyond their immediate material. Computer science and its close cousin computer programming are like that.

Despite the popular notion, computers are as dumb as a box of rocks after you've removed all the smart ones.  Why?  Well, because a computer is, almost literally, rock.  It's a series of electrical connections among a collection of silicon with some clever etching.

Perhaps an primitive description, but closer to true than the thought that computers might someday exceed the power of all human reason.

No.  They are dumb.  They might do monumental things; indeed, the very reason we build, program, and use them is to do things we normally can't without an awful lot of time, as in by the time the sun goes super nova.

But just as they cannot build themselves, they cannot program themselves.  The marvel of machine learning algorithms, deep learning, the internet, Only at the hand of human beings.
