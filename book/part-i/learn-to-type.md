# Almost a Prerequisite

```{admonition} Learn to Type
_I often end up rewriting. Sometimes I do that without ever finding the bug. I get to the point where I can just feel that it’s in this part here. I’m just not very comfortable about this part. It’s a mess. It really shouldn’t be that way. Rather than tweak it a little bit at a time, I’ll just throw away a couple hundred lines of code, rewrite it from scratch, and often then the bug is gone. Sometimes I feel guilty about that. Is that a failure on my part? I didn’t understand what the bug was. I didn’t find the bug. I just dropped a bomb on the house and blew up all the bugs and built a new house. In some sense, the bug eluded me. But if it becomes the right solution, maybe it’s OK. You’ve done it faster than you would have by finding it._

## Coding is _Tactile_

Below is, with some slight differences, the typewriter I purchased in high school and used for almost a decade.

Many my age or a tad younger will recall the purchase of a Commodore or Apple in the very early days of personal computing in the 1980s.  I had no such luck. But what I lacked in access to 'technology' I, in some ways, made up for by learning to type and type fast.

That is, you may not think it important, but it makes a gargantuan difference in your coding work. The code you, the programmer, must type (also know as the _source code_) might be hundreds of lines of code for a relatively simple program.  That is, you'll be doing a __lot__ of typing.

So much so that the ability to code --- without having to look at the keyboard or hunt and peck with just any finger that's available --- will take away just another frustration of the process and, ___importantly___, will allow your mind to focus on the task at hand (and your fingertips) rather than on the tedious labor of find a key or two.

The benefit of learning the basic `finger:key mapping` is one you cannot appreciate until you have both a great deal to code but poor keyboarding skills. When you can type and type well, you'll be less hesitant to test and re-test coding tests, drills, experiments, whatever.

That's all to say that coding is as much a ___manual___ labor as it is a mental one, and you'll learn by your tactile sense as well as your sense of design and your aptitude for problem-solving.

___Learn to type properly, i.e., with proper form and all 10 fingers.___

In coding, keyboarding, i.e., the manual effort to put code to text, is, for most mere mortals, an essential skill.
