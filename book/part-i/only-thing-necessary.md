# Only One Thing is Necessary

```{admonition} •

 _I think that it's extraordinarily important that we in computer science keep fun in computing. When it started out, it was an awful lot of fun. Of course, the paying customers got shafted every now and then, and after a while we began to take their complaints seriously. We began to feel as if we really were responsible for the successful, error-free perfect use of these machines. I don't think we are. I think we're responsible for stretching them, setting them off in new directions, and keeping fun in the house. I hope the field of computer science never loses its sense of fun. ... What's in your hands, I think and hope, is intelligence: the ability to see the machine as more than when you were first led up to it, that you can make it more._

## Looking Through the Wrong End of the Telescope

When the Soviets launched Sputnik in 1957 Homer Hickam was 14, living in an impoverished coal-mining town in West Virginia, and destined by the expectations of the day to live a short life hundreds of feet underground.

Sputnik changed that trajectory.  So fascinated did he become by it that in high school he, with three other friends, taught himself the science and math of building and launching rockets.

He tells the story of his overcoming his inaptitude of math in his push to improve their rocket launches:

````{card}

> I did the calculations, assuming our rocket reached maximum velocity ... The result equaled a velocity of ... 545.45 miles per hour. When I recalculated, I came up with the same result. ... I found it difficult to imagine ... our rockets could really go that fast... "This can’t be right."

> Quentin took a quick look and pushed the notebook back to me.

> "It is exactly correct. Keep going. Don’t lose your nerve."
>
> "I haven’t lost my nerve!" I snapped. But I had. The next step was to do the equations for ... the De Laval nozzle, and privately I quaked at the thought of attempting [the equations] ... dozens of them, intricate, enmeshed, one building on the other — one wrong, all wrong.
>
> "You had the calculus class, Quentin. You work them."
>
> "No," he said adamantly. "Miss Riley gave you the book. You know calculus as well as I do. Quit stalling!"
>
> My confidence was gone. Doing those equations was like running a four-minute mile — something possible only for someone far greater than I.
>
> Quentin leaned forward and shook his finger at me.
>
> "Listen, old man, if you don’t work these equations, what will be the point of all we’ve done? We might end up building a good rocket that’ll fly just fine, and all the grown-ups and teachers will brag on us. Who knows? We might even be able to bluff our way past the judges at the science fair. But you’ll know and I’ll know — all the boys will know — what could have been done if you hadn’t lost your nerve. We could have built a great rocket."

The wannabe programmer often suffers hesitancy from the math that might be involved.  Either from prior experience or, beginning as this page did with Euclid, you might think a substantial amount of math is a prerequisite.

That is not true. Learning a programming language and putting it to good use does _not_ require a heavy math background.

True, math and plying away at programs have much in common.  But to start to code often requires little math.

But, as it turns out, taking the attitude that you'd rather not deal with math at all when coding is like looking through the wrong end of a telescope.

Rather, do not be surprised that, in your drive to build better and more interesting programs, you learn quite a bit of math and, more, the day comes when you'll want to know even more because you begin to appreciate how far you can travel.

The telescope is meant to show you the universe's expanse; not narrow your interests.

Besides some hardware, software, and time, the only other things you need are the ability to speak one human language and the desire learn to code.

Language isn't merely a medium by which information is conveyed.  It's also an assurance that you can learn a programming language. Not only is the latter simpler, but the neurological feats necessary for you to both understand and transmit thought to another human being far exceeds what is required to learn any other subject, even how to write computer programs.

Have you these, only left is the desire to make the computer do your bidding.  All else will follow.
