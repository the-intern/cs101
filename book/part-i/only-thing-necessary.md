```{admonition} What Might Have Been

Quentin leaned forward and shook his finger at me.

_Listen, old man, if you don’t work these equations, what will be the point of all we’ve done? We might end up building a good rocket that’ll fly just fine, and all the grown-ups and teachers will brag on us. Who knows? We might even be able to bluff our way past the judges at the science fair. But you’ll know and I’ll know — all the boys will know — what could have been done if you hadn’t lost your nerve. We could have built a great rocket._

# The One Thing Necessary

When the Soviets launched Sputnik Homer Hickam was 14, living in an impoverished West Virginia mining town, and destined by the expectations of the day to live a short life hundreds of feet underground breathing coal dust in a dark shaft.

Sputnik changed that path.

So much did that satellite fascinate him that in high school, though otherwise fearful of math, he learned more than enough to launch rockets and predict their trajectories.

He recalls the moment such ineptitude had to be overcome:

````{card}

> I did the calculations, assuming our rocket reached maximum velocity ... The result equaled a velocity of ... 545.45 miles per hour. When I recalculated, I came up with the same result. ... I found it difficult to imagine ... our rockets could really go that fast... _This can’t be right._

> ___I haven’t lost my nerve!___ I snapped. But I had. The next step was to do the equations for ... the De Laval nozzle, and privately I quaked at the thought of attempting [the equations] ... dozens of them, intricate, enmeshed, one building on the other — one wrong, all wrong.

> _No,_ he said adamantly. _Miss Riley gave you the book. You know calculus as well as I do. Quit stalling!_

> My confidence was gone. Doing those equations was like running a four-minute mile — something possible only for someone far greater than I.

Hickam and his friends would go on to win the gold and silver medal in the area of propulsion at the 1960 National Science Fair.  Instead of a coal mine, Hickam went to college, and worked as an engineer for NASA.

Maybe a bit dramatic, but worth a pause.

Hickam didn't

The wannabe programmer often suffers hesitancy from the math that might be involved.  Either from prior experience or, beginning as this page did with Euclid, you might think a substantial amount of math is a prerequisite.

That is not true. Learning a programming language and putting it to good use does _not_ require a heavy math background.

True, math and plying away at programs have much in common.  But to start to code often requires little math.

But, as it turns out, taking the attitude that you'd rather not deal with math at all when coding is like looking through the wrong end of a telescope.

Rather, do not be surprised that, in your drive to build better and more interesting programs, you learn quite a bit of math and, more, the day comes when you'll want to know even more because you begin to appreciate how far you can travel.

The telescope is meant to show you the universe's expanse; not narrow your interests.

Besides some hardware, software, and time, the only other things you need are the ability to speak one human language and the desire learn to code.

Language isn't merely a medium by which information is conveyed.  It's also an assurance that you can learn a programming language. Not only is the latter simpler, but the neurological feats necessary for you to both understand and transmit thought to another human being far exceeds what is required to learn any other subject, even how to write computer programs.

Have you these, only left is the desire to make the computer do your bidding.  All else will follow.
