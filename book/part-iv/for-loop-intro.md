# Python's `for` Loop

You've seen the `while` loop but, with the introduction of a second `iterable` (the string being the first and the list the second), it's time to learn the `for` loop.

The while loop typically is designed to repeat a specific block of code an _unknown_ number of times until a condition is met. In some cases, it is intended to repeat without end.

But if the number of loops can be known ahead of time, you typically will use the _for_ loop.

When we say the number of loops "can be known ahead of time," that doesn't mean we necessarily know a specific number.

Rather, it means the number of repetitions can be known with respect to something else. Thus, when you know you need to iterate over a string or list, you know that the repetitions will be _no more_ than the size of the string or list.

## Syntax

The most basic and common _for_ loop contains two keywords and two variable names.
