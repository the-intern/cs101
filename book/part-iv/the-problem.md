# The Problem

We've already used one data structure, the string.

But as data structures go, it's a bit difficult to deal with. For example, you cannot insert new characters or sub-strings into an existing string; you can't update a character in a string; and it holds but one data `type` --- a string.

```{note}

That sounds odd, but that's an accident arising from how Python defines a string. Other, statically-typed languages have a `char` data type in addition to an array of `chars` called `strings`. But more on that maybe later.

```

That's all to say that strings are a bit unwieldy.
