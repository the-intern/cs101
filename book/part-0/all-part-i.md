## Mind

The story runs that, above the entrance to ancient schools of philosophy, a cautionary placard read

> Let no one enter who has not studied _The Elements_.

__The Elements__ are those of Euclid, the ancient mathematician whose work on the principles, theorems, and proofs in geometry were considered an essential part of a basic education.

Why? Among other reasons, the close study of it trained the mind to be more precise in its reasoning, the very attribute that enables human beings to irrigate deserts, cure illnesses, construct cities, cultivate land, build a culture.

Abraham Lincoln, when traveling the court circuit on horseback, studied the __The Elements__ -- and not because he aspired to land surveyor.  He sought to improve his ability to reason, to argue, to understand.

We might study biology or chemistry or history to understand the subject.  But a number of topics we study foremost for something beyond that.

True, geometry has a first end.  But few students make it their profession.  Some proficiency might be required for advanced studies.

But in addition to all that, it is the discipline's ability to aid in thinking.

Computer science and its close cousin computer programming are like that.

That is, you may never engineer large chunks of software; but you __will__ be expected to identify, analyze, and solve problems.

And, yes, primarily __you__ are the one solving the problem.

Despite the popular notion, computers are as dumb as a box of rocks after, as they say, you've taken out all the smart ones.

Why?  Well, because a computer is, almost literally, rock.  It's a series of electrical connections among a collection of silicon chips with a lot of clever etching.

Maybe that's a little unfair to the computer.  Maybe.  Still, it is closer to true than the thought that computers might someday exceed the power of all human reason.

No. Computers are dumb.  They might do monumental things; indeed, the very reason we build, program, and use them is to do things we normally can't without an awful lot of time, as in by the time our Sun goes supernova.

But just as they cannot build themselves, they cannot program themselves.

Somewhere a former student of computer science told the story of the first day of programming class.  The teacher had her desk equipped with tubs of ice cream, bowls, spoons, and the toppings.

She would make every student a sundae, to the student's taste.

When the first student came up for a treat, the teacher asked what he wanted.

"A single scoop of vanilla ..."

The teach promptly dropped a scoop right in his hand.

Stunned and now sticky with ice cream, the student learned over the next several minutes that, computers take you quite literally.  You can't assume anything and your instructions need to be quite detailed.

The marvel of machine learning algorithms, deep learning, the internet, and myriad other advancements in computational technology all come at the hand of the human person who provides the problem solving and the detail.

For the human being is singular in his rational nature.  He grapples with the obstacles and difficulties and questions and issues of his mind and world.  Upon a solution, he can sometimes put that solution into effect.  But precise, orderly thinking, even if hidden in a tangle of creativity, is required.

The training afforded by learning to program a dumb computer helps build that type of thinking.

## Math

However, learning a programming language and putting it to good use is _not_ the same as learning math.

True, math and plying away at programs have much in common.  But to start to code often requires little math.

A relief to many, it comes with a caveat:  Do not be surprised that you learn quite a bit of math along the way and, more, the day comes when you'll want to know matter deeper because you begin to appreciate how far math takes you with computers.

## Motivation

Besides some hardware, software, and time, the only other things you need are the ability to speak one ordinary language and the desire learn to code.

Language isn't merely a medium by which information is conveyed.  It's also an assurance that you can learn a programming language.

Not only is the latter simpler, but the neurological feats necessary for you to both understand and transmit thought to another human being far exceeds what is required to learn any other subject, even how to write computer programs.

Have you these, only left is the desire to make the computer do your bidding.  All else will follow.

# B. How

```{admonition} Edsger Dijkstra
Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.
```

This beginning course in computer programming, sometimes called _coding_, comes with the three goals mentioned earlier.

The _means_ by which these will be achieved vary.

First, we'll be using the programming language _Python_.

In Python you'll do exercises, take some quizzes, and build small projects.

However, all that will lead to a final project of building a internet search engine, one that crawls the web, indexes pages, and returns ranked results for a given search.

Along the way, you'll learn some computer science and, because the web is part of the over arching project, something of the workings of the internet, networks, and perhaps even some of the __collective intelligence__ that their data offer.

But, remember, whatever the particulars of any given programming, computer science, or coding curriculum, the very core is how problem solving -- how to analyze issues, assemble the means to solve them, and put it altogether in such a computer program.

## What is a Search Engine and How is it Built?

_What is_ a _search engine_?


For example, the project to build a search engine can be broken down into three large steps:

1. retrieve the data from the internet
2. build an index of the sites discovered
3. return pages ranked by their relevance

Of course, each of these three larger steps require smaller, sub-steps.  But the process is always the same: analyze, solve, synthesize.
