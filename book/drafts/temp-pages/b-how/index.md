# B. How

This beginning course in programming, sometimes called _coding_, comes with the three goals mentioned earlier.

The _means_ by which these will be achieved vary.

First, we'll be using the programming language _Python_.

Using that language, we'll use exercises, quizzes, small projects, and finally, a much larger project of building a search engine that crawls the web, indexes pages, and returns ranked results of any given search.

Along the way, and because the web is part of the over arching project, we will touch on the workings of the web, networks, and perhaps even some of the __collective intelligence__ that the internet offers.

But whatever the particulars of any given computer programming, computer science, or coding curriculum, the very core is how to solve problems »»» how to break down (i.e., analyze) the issues, assemble the means by which to solve these, and put those means together in such a fashion that program both solves the problem and is reasonably efficient.
