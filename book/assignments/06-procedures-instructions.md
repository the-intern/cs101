# Challenge - 06 - Procedures

## **_Note_**: Anywhere you see `pass`, you **must** remove it for your code to work.

## [1] Write a procedure `sum_of_squares()` that takes in three integers and returns the sum of their squares:

```python
def sum_of_squares(a, b, c):
    # note: remove the word pass below!
    # and replace it with your code
    pass

```

## [2] Write a procedure `half_length()` that takes as arguments a string and returns a float representing half the string's length:

```python
def half_length(s):
    # note: remove the word pass below!
    # and replace it with your code
    pass
```

## [3] Write a procedure `sum_code_points()` that takes in three characters (**_single_** letter strings, e.g., 'a', 'r', '3') and return the sum of their Unicode code points. From the Python docs:

> Given a string representing one Unicode character, return an integer representing the Unicode code point of that character. For example, ord('a') returns the integer 97 ... This is the inverse of chr().

Thus:

```python
>>> ord('a')
97
>>> ord('b')
98
>>> ord('4')
52
```

```python
def sum_code_points(x, y, z):
    # remember to substitute the keyword pass with your own code
    pass
```

## [4] Write a procedure `incr()` that increments a float or integer by 1 and returns that incremented value

```python
def incr(x):
    pass
```

## [5] Write a procedure `get_last_chr()` that returns the very last character of a string

```python
def get_last_chr(a_string):
    pass
```

## [6] According to Newton's second law of motion, force can be expressed as the product of mass and acceleration of the body. Write a procedure `get_force()` that, given the mass and acceleration of an object, returns the force.

```python
def get_force(mass, acceleration):
    pass
```

## [7] Write a procedure `abba_ize()` that, taking in two strings, returns a string that is the first string, followed by two repetitions of the second string, followed by the first string.

```python
def abba_ize(a,b):
    pass
```
