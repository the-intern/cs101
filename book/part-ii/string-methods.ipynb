    "Before we go too far, it's important to understand what procedures or functions or methods do.  `Procedure` is the more generic term and let's use that for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "You've seen at least two procedures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `print()`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `str()`\n",
    "\n",
    "The `print()` procedure does just that.  However, `str()` takes in an integer and `returns` a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now think about that. The `print()` procedure returns nothing; it simply carries out the procedure of printing to the console and stops.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But `str()` __returns__ something.  \n",
    "\n",
    "That means you can __assign__ a variable to the return value.  For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> num = 200\n",
    "# store the string '200' in variable num_converted\n",
    ">>> num_converted = str(num)\n",
    ">>> print(num_converted)\n",
    "'200'\n",
    "# type of num_converted\n",
    ">>> print(type(num_converted))\n",
    "<class 'str'>\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `find()` method is a built-in procedure, or method, provided by Python, and __operates on__ strings.  That is, it is a string method.  Moreover, and importantly, it __returns__ a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The return value or output of `find()` is the position of the string where the specified sub-string is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "```<search string>.find(<target string>)```"
